### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**I'm a WordPress Developer working in the Bernese Oberland in Switzerland.**

- I'm currently living my best life as a Partner and Developer at [Say Hello GmbH](https://sayhello.ch/).
- I've been building custom CMS and web apps since 2001 and working with WordPress since 2003. I also did a seven-year-stint as a TYPO3 developer, until 2018.
- You might also know me from [WordPress Switzerland](https://github.com/wpswitzerland), cubetech, !frappant or Burson-Marsteller. If you're a thousand years old, like me, you might even remember me from Gossweiler Media AG, Jungfrau Zeitung, Artsoft Ltd. in Surrey, Cable & Wireless in Bracknell, or Solomons in Camberley and Lightwater.
- I update my personal blog occasionally at [permanenttourist.ch](https://permanenttourist.ch)
- You can reach me on Twitter [@howellsmead](https://twitter.com/howellsmead)
