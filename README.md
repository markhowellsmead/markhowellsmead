### Hi there 👋

**I'm a WordPress Developer living in Switzerland. I've been building web sites and web apps for over 30 years.**

- I'm currently running web agency [Say Hello GmbH](https://sayhello.ch/), building websites and API integrations whilst also providing technical and conceptual consultancy to our agency partners.
- After a few years building static websites by hand, I became a CMS developer in 2001 and I've been working with WordPress since 2003. I also did a seven-year stint as a TYPO3 developer between 2011 and 2018.
- You might know me from [WordPress Switzerland](https://www.wpswitzerland.ch/), cubetech, !frappant or Burson-Marsteller. If you're a thousand years old, like me, you might even remember me from Gossweiler Media AG, Jungfrau Zeitung, Artsoft Ltd. in Surrey, Cable & Wireless in Bracknell, or Solomons in Camberley and Lightwater.
- I update my personal blog occasionally at [permanenttourist.ch](https://permanenttourist.ch)
- You can reach me on Bluesky [@permanenttourist.ch](https://bsky.app/profile/permanenttourist.ch)
